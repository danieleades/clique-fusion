# Licensing

Clique Fusion is available under two licensing options:

## Option 1: GNU General Public License v3.0 (Default)

**When to use:** Open source projects, research, education, or any project where you're comfortable with copyleft requirements.

**Key requirements:**

- You can use, modify, and distribute this software freely
- Any software that incorporates Clique Fusion must also be licensed under GPL v3
- You must provide source code to users of your software

**This is the default license** - if you're using Clique Fusion without a separate commercial agreement, you're using it under GPL v3.

## Option 2: Commercial License

**When to use:** Proprietary software, commercial products, or any situation where GPL v3's copyleft requirements are incompatible with your needs.
